# VBA-challenge

The code assumes the data is ordered by ticker-date. That is, it shows one ticker at a time and for that ticker, the dates are sorted from earliest to latest.
This is how the provided data was sorted.

The code will run across every sheet in a given workbook. It will format the results as well.

I used some online sources for information on how to apply formatting, including conditional formatting, within VBA. These are listed below:
